# CFPB-mini-project
This mini project from 2021 was an assignment for the "IMA Math-to-Industry Boot Camp". The assignment was to pick any publicly available dataset and perform some exploratory analysis. 

The project is a visual exploration in nature -- it looks at data of complaints submitted to the **Consumer Finance Protection Bureau**, and investigates a giant spike in 2020. What happened? (Yes, COVID, but what exactly?) 

This turns out to be a question which can be answered purely with simple plots and some basic domain research  -- no fancy models needed. 

The project can be viewed at the Jupyter Notebook: `CFPB_mini_project.ipynb`.

There is an accompanying mini presentation in [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mDMXmrxDLWnJ23a7buCNRPYWTGmzBzDKZHyHTqb21Q4/edit?usp=sharing). (Use slideshow mode!)


The other files are:
`preprocessing_data.ipynb`, explains the data was downloaded from the CFPB website and then reduced in size by random sampling.
`scratch_work.ipynb`, contains slightly more exploration beyond the main file, not all of which necessarily led to interesting observations.
`slideshow_transcript.md`, contains a prepared transcript for the slides. (Part of the assignment was to give a live presentation.)
