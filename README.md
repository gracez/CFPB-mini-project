# CFPB-mini-project
This mini project from 2021 was an assignment for the "IMA Math-to-Industry Boot Camp".

The project is exploratory in nature -- it looks at data of complaints submitted to the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, and investigates a giant spike in 2020. What happened? 
(Yes, COVID, but what exactly?)

The project can be viewed in `CFPB_mini_project.ipynb`.

There is an accompany mini presentation in [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mDMXmrxDLWnJ23a7buCNRPYWTGmzBzDKZHyHTqb21Q4/edit?usp=sharing). (Use slideshow mode!)
