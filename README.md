# CFPB-mini-project
This mini project from 2021 was an assignment for the "IMA Math-to-Industry Boot Camp". 
It can be viewed at the Jupyter Notebook file: `CFPB_mini_project.ipynb`.

This project is exploratory and visual in nature -- it looks at data of complaints submitted to the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, and investigates a giant spike in 2020. What caused it? (Yes, COVID, but why exactly?)

It is an example of a question which can be answered well purely with simple visualizations  -- no models needed. 

There is an accompany mini presentation in [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mDMXmrxDLWnJ23a7buCNRPYWTGmzBzDKZHyHTqb21Q4/edit?usp=sharing). (Use slideshow mode!)
