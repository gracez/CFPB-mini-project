# A question that particularly stood out from the data: Why is there a huge spike in the number of complaints in 2020? (Yes, COVID, but why exactly?)

Notice that a disproportionate number of complaints were submitted against 3 specific companies:

**Equifax, TransUnion, and Experian. **

Each of these top 3 companies received an order of magnitude more complaints than any one remaining company. 
On this plot we can see there is a relatively small increase in the number of complaints against “Other” companies, but a massive upswing (at least double) in the amount of complaints against Equifax, TransUnion, and Experian.
**These 3 companies are exactly the 3 major credit bureaus in the US. **
This suggests the increased complaints in 2020 are mainly directed against credit bureaus.
Let’s see what the monthly distribution of complaints against credit bureaus looks like, and whether in 2020 it reflects a COVID-19 timeline.

In this plot, each line is one year. 2020 is the blue line at the top. The plot ONLY includes complaints filed against the 3 major credit bureaus.
You can see that 2020 has a completely different distribution of credit bureau complaints per month! It increases significantly over time, while all other years are approximately constant throughout the year.

In March 2020, the first COVID lock-downs begin in the US. We can see that complaints against credit bureaus rise sharply. 
So, are they extra bored in lockdown? Extra angry? Or is there some other underlying explanation? Also, why does the rate of complaints against credit bureaus keep rising afterwards, and throughout the year?

**In April 2020, it is announced by the FTC that Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion will provide free weekly credit reports during COVID. Previously, you could only get one free credit report per year.**
So probably more complaints are being filed simply because more credit reports are being requested. People notice more issues and inaccuracies on their credit reports, because they are looking at those reports more often! 
Even though free weekly credit reports only become available in April, the increased rate of credit reports requests begins as early as March. This could be explained by people beginning to request credit reports at an elevated rate in March, due to COVID lockdowns causing unemployment and other financial stresses.

Finally, as an aside, we notice **an abnormal peak in the pink line.** What happened in September 2017? Well, if we look at the 2017 company data by month, we see that the sudden jump in complaints in September is completely directed at Equifax. The other color bars do not change. 
What happened?

**Answer: Huge data breach at Equifax.**
